// Write a JS function that stores the name and age of two persons in objects and then filters them by minimum age.
//     The input comes as array of string elements. The first element is the minimum age. The second and third
// elements are the name and age of the first person and the fourth and fifth elements â€“ the name and age
// of the second person. The three age parameters need to be parsed as numbers.
//     The output should be printed to the console.
